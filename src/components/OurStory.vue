                                Hi, my name is Camille Galang. A passionate Web Designer and part of the Start Up team. Designing a website has been what 
                                I love doing since I was in high school. I am hunger for knowledge and determination to turn codes into a lovely design. 
                                Also, I constantly learning about the latest website architectures. Moreover, I love the logic and structure of coding and 
                                always strive to write elegant and efficient code. <br><br> I believe that great design is in detail and must support 
                                functionality. This way, we can be sure that both design and usability will be considered. I have been designing a website 
                                for 3 years. I specialize in standards-based XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript web development. Using the latest development 
                                principles and techniques, I have the confidence to develop a website that is search engine friendly.

                                Allow me to introduce myself; my name is Justine Nicdao and I am a member of the Start Up team. I've always been fascinated by how a 
                                website works, which is why I chose this path and pursued my interests throughout my journey. After two years of learning how to operate a 
                                website, my forte is Python, Java, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript. Engaging in collaborative work and in project like these help me maximize my 
                                abilities. <br><br>Furthermore, I contributed with the graphic design work of the team and am also knowledgeable about the website's architecture. 
                                With the experience I've gained, I'm responsible for our team's current expansion. Additionally, I am skilled in image manipulation and video 
                                editing. These will be my tools for assisting in the further development of Start Up and for what it will become in the future.
